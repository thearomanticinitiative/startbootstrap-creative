                <hr>
                <p class="center">On May 8th 2016 I read the word aromanticism for the very first time. It was a Sunday and I had recently moved into my first apartment. </p>
                <p class="center">I was sitting on my new balcony, my laptop in front of me with a nagging sensation in my gut. </p>
                <p class="center">All my life or at least the last ten years I was asked about my boyfriend. Most of the time I answered, that I didn’t had time for a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend for that matter. I didn’t had one or ever wanted one. To be honest, the only times I dreamed about a boyfriend were when I wanted to go to the movies or something and no one had time for me.</p>
                <p class="center">In my high school years I was believed to be a lesbian, because my best friend at that time liked to hold my hand, kiss and cuddle me. I didn’t mind that, it was just how she showed affection and it never was sexual or romantic in anyway. I’m totally sure about that, because she always had a boyfriend and I never minded that.</p>
                <p class="center">I never actually thought about having a romantic or sexual partner. If the thought came up, it was always forced on me by other people.</p>
                <p class="center">My closest friend for the last eight years – to be clear: a friend far more trustworthy than the girl I knew in high school – hadn’t had a boyfriend either for a long time, so it didn’t come up that often. I don’t know if people thought we were a couple, but I wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
                <p class="center">My colleagues sometimes asked about my boyfriend, but most of them don’t notice when I changed the subject or told them I didn’t have time for that. Working nearly 30 hours a week and studying, I don’t have that much free time on my hands. </p>
                <p class="center">But on that day on my balcony I was desperate to find out what was wrong with me. Of course I knew that I acted different than the others around me. One of my younger brothers had already married, the other is engaged. I should feel the need to have a boyfriend. I should want to have sex. Shouldn’t I?</p>
                <p class="center">A year earlier a good friend of mine wanted to help me. She wanted to put me on a dating website. I never get angry or lose control of my emotions, but this caused our first and only fight. After I got home from her apartment I was still so angry – at myself. Why had I reacted like that? Why had I felt so threatened and – in lack of a better word – abused? So I put me on a dating website and started chatting with people. It wasn’t bad. Up until the point they started to talk about romance and plans for their future and weddings and stuff. After three months I gave up and buried all the bad emotions, as I had since the first time someone had asked me why I didn’t have a boyfriend.</p>
                <p class="center">The months before I moved – into the my parent’s new house (it has two apartments) – people started asking me, if my boyfriend was going to move in with me in that apartment, because of the amount of money and work I spent to make it my home. My honest to god first internal reaction was always the same: why on earth would he move in with me? It was my apartment! Of course I knew how the majority of society thinks about this: Finding the love of your life, popping a few kids, hopefully not splitting up during the process of raising them and then die together. But I never felt the need for that. I never wanted that for me. </p>
                <p class="center">I kept smiling telling them that of course my apartment would be big enough for the two of us, even for three, if I would get pregnant and kept my thoughts to myself. Up until I sat on the balcony and decided that it was enough. I wouldn’t close my eyes any longer. So I started searching. I found asexuality and I found another website: <a class="link" href="http://www.aromantik.de">href="http://www.aromantik.de</a>. After reading about asexuality I finally found aromanticism. There was a “how to tell if you are aromantic” section and one for asexuality as well and after reading both, I started to understand. My lack of interest for sex and a romantic relationship wasn’t me being childish or picky, I just wasn’t interested. And I wasn’t the only one. My appreciation for aesthetic beauty wasn’t just a crush, it was just appreciation for aesthetic beauty and didn’t have to be more.</p>
                <p class="center">I began to understand. I started reading every site I could find, I joined groups on Facebook and Tumblr and started chatting with people. People who welcomed me, who understood what my alloromantic friends couldn’t.</p>
                <p class="center">I don’t remember much from that day, it was so mixed with raw emotions. I wasn’t broken. I wasn’t alone.  I remember the feelings of pure bliss, of euphoria. I remember the panic, the fear and the heartbreak for the future I always assumed I would have, even if I never wanted it.</p>
                <p class="center">I remember feeling free. Free of stress that I had to want something I didn’t. Freedom from rules I didn’t understand and wanted no part in. Freedom from what I always expected to be my life. Freedom to choose.</p>
                <p class="center">I remember feeling alone. Knowing that everyone of my favourite people in the world would find his or her significant other and I wouldn’t. Knowing, that people I loved, would pity me. Even or because I felt free and right.</p>
                <p class="center">It took me months to come to terms with myself and sometimes I still struggle. I told my friends and most of my family about me.</p>
                <p class="center">Whether you accept yourself or you still learning to do so: You are not alone. We are not alone. We are not broken. We are whole.</p>
