                        <p class="text-faded">Lithromantic and Akoiromantic are
                        two terms that mean the same thing. However,
                        lithromantic is older and was the original term. The
                        prefix lith- means stone, and the term was coined by
                        the tumblr blog lithromantic. An anonymous user asked
                        why they chose the prefix stone for their romantic
                        orientation, which is a fair question. The following is
                        an excerpt from <a class="link special" href=
                        "http://lithromantic.tumblr.com/post/48021635860/i-understand-the-term-lithromantic-and-what-it">
                        lithromantic’s reply</a>: “We looked at other terms for
                        romantic and sexual orientations, and we noticed that
                        most of them relied of latin or greek roots. So we went
                        looking for a root which meant something at all like
                        “experiences without desire to reciprocate”. We didn’t
                        find anything. I mean, anything close, not anything we
                        could figure out how to twist around and make it mean
                        what we wanted. But, we’re both AFAB queers, one of us
                        Stone, so we were familiar with Stone Butch sexuality.
                        For those of you who don’t know, Butch/Femme is sort of
                        the Old Guard of lesbian sexuality (not to say
                        butch/femme isn’t still a thing, but a particular type
                        of butche/femme was historically the norm for
                        lesbians), and Stone is a particular type of sexual
                        expression. Someone who is Stone likes to provide
                        sexual stimulation to a partner, but does not like to
                        receive sexual stimulation themself. This was the
                        closest allegory that we could find, and we chose to
                        call this in our naming of this romantic
                        orientation.”</p>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p class="text-faded">However, controversy soon arose
                        about the term. Some people were concerned that the
                        term was appropriation, and decided to make an
                        alternative. The most commonly used alternatives were
                        akoiromantic and akoineromantic (not in common use
                        anymore). An anonymous user asked <a class=

                        pride-flags-for-us</a>, “Do you happen to know an
                        alternative to lith or am I fine to use it (i'm a
                        transboy with demiboy leanings)? It's really the only
                        sexuality that described my sexuality the best. But
                        I've heard asexual is similar..” and they replied, "The
                        prefix lith- is appropriative of lesbian culture which
                        is why the lith- communities are working towards
                        creating a different prefix. So far akoine- is the most
                        accepted one. Anyone can use the akoine- label as long
                        as it fits your sexuality/romantic”. <a class=

                        Another post</a> about it commented on it as neutrally
                        as possible: “Some people take problem with
                        lithromantic as it comes from stone butch terminology,
                        which is appropriated from the lesbian community. I’m
                        not making any definitive statements about the issue
                        currently as I haven’t seen any actual
                        lesbian-identified people speaking out about this, and
                        most commentary I have seen comes from people outside
                        the lesbian community saying it’s appropriation.
                        However, that doesn’t mean it’s not appropriation. I’m
                        not making any definitive statements about it either
                        way at the moment, but since it’s still a debatable
                        issue, it might be best to avoid the term and use
                        akoiromantic instead.” Akoiromantic emerged from this
                        discussion as an alternative to lithromantic.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p class="text-faded">Many lesbians argued against this
                        being appropriation, however, and some spoke out
                        against using akoiromantic. The following are excerpts
                        from tumblr user <a class="link special" href=
                        "http://rainbow-after-the-stormy.tumblr.com/post/97502396287/i-cant-seem-to-find-anyhting-about-why">
                        ladyxaxa’s argument</a>: “Hey! Stone femme (yes, it’s a
                        thing) lithromantic queer woman here. I’ve been tracing
                        this issue for a while, and I agree that most of the
                        people saying it’s appropriation aren’t actually
                        lesbian or stone identified. Meanwhile, the creator of
                        the term (who does identify as stone/lithsexual) has
                        explicitly said that it’s not appropriation, and I and
                        my homoromantic asexual QPP agree. In fact, I would
                        argue that not calling it lithromantic is erasure. . .
                        . Basically, what I’m trying to say that by not calling
                        it lith, it erases the history that the explanation of
                        this experience comes from lesbian/stone activism.
                        Ironically, by calling something appropriation that
                        really, really isn’t because queer woman and stone
                        people specifically intended it for sharing, the
                        history of that sharing is erased. There are ‘actual
                        lesbians’ (as many posts put it) who use this term and
                        think it’s okay for you to use this term if you
                        identify with it (and I’m obviously not saying you
                        can’t use akoiromantic or another proposed term,
                        although personally I think etymologically lith makes
                        so much more sense specifically because it retains the
                        link with stoneness). In other words, the concept that
                        lith/akoiromantic indicates would not have been
                        articulated when it was if not for lesbians and stone
                        people and them relating their experiences to
                        aromanticism, and I think it’s important to recognize
                        that by retaining the words that we gave it.” So
                        really, the only difference between akoiromantic and
                        lithromantic is their roots, not the meaning.
                        Currently, both are recognized in the aromantic
                        community. (Note: the author is neither
                        lith/akoiromantic nor lesbian. This is not meant to be
                        an influential piece, but informative.)</p>
