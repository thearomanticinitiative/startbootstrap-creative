              <p>“Women who perhaps suffered most in this period were, ironically, those like the Queen who did not wish to marry. Tudor society did not have many avenues open to single women and, following the Reformation, those avenues were even less. Before, women were able to become nuns and look forward to a rewarding life in convents, perhaps be a Mother Superior one day. But with the Reformation, the convents were closed. Wealthy single women (heiresses of property) could look forward to being mistress of their estates and wield the power in the community this would bring, but for poor women, the only long-term “career” really open to them was domestic service. It was not surprising, therefore, that most women married. Marriage was seen as the desirable state for both men and women, and single women were sometimes looked upon with suspicion. It was mainly single women who were accused of being witches by their neighbours.”</p>

Single men and women are “extra”; psychiatry shapes this picture of singles. In a survey taken in 1957, eighty percent of Americans believed that people who preferred to remain single were “sick,” “neurotic,” or “immoral.” Unmarried women were deemed suspect, as they could steal away a husband at any time.

              <p>Unmarried women were rounded up and imprisoned in an effort to control women’s productive and reproductive rights, in between World Wars I and II. Women’s roles in society were starting to diversify, and this was an effort to reassert control. In order to be released, a man would have to come and pay for the right to marry her. This affected women who could not find a man to marry and women who did not want to marry due to either economic factors, her own autonomy, or the simple desire not to marry. </p>

                    <p>“If heterosexuality is one of the ways in which men’s power over women is maintained, then lesbianism is or can be a threat to that power. This aspect of resistance involves all women outside of heterosexuality, including celibate or unmarried women. Like lesbians, they are all women who are not subject to men’s social and sexual power through a personal relationship. Thus, although attacks were made on unmarried women teachers primarily as spinsters rather than as lesbians, it will be argued that they were maligned for being outside heterosexuality.”

              <p>“While emotional problems are common among single men, a number of unwed men adjust completely to life without women and find a thoroughly satisfying existence alone. Some of these seem to have found fulfillment in their working life exclusively. Examples can be found in every field. Other men find a sense of completion by rounding out their business lives with an engrossing hobby, often in the sports field…</p>
              <p>However well he may adjust to his lonely life, the single man suffers disabilities that seem to be traceable directly to his bachelorhood. Unwed men are much less healthy than their married brothers. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company studies show that more than four times as many unattached men as married men (ages 20–74) die of tuberculosis. At ages 20–44, five to six times as many unmarried men as husbands die of influenza and pneumonia. Prior to mid-life, nine divorced men are victims of cirrhosis of the liver to each married man killed by that disease.”</p>

              <p>“Our boys, when they arrive at years of maturity and can take earn of a wife, should get married, and there should not be a lot of young men growing up in our midst who ought to be, but are not married. While I do not make the remark to apply to individual cases, I am firmly of the opinion that a large number of unmarried men, over the age of twenty-four years, is a dangerous element in any community, and an element upon which society should look with a jealous eye. For every man knowing himself, knows how his fellow-man is constituted; and if men do not marry, they are too apt to do something worse. Then, brethren, encourage our young men to marry, and see that they are furnished employment, so that they can marry” (George Q. Cannon, Annual Conference at Salt Lake City, Sunday morning, April 7, 1878. Reported by George F. Gibbs. Journal of Discourses, vol. 20, p.7).</p>

            <hr class="light">
            <p class="text-faded">Queerplatonic was originally coined in a 2010 Dreamwidth journal entry. It was considered a good term because not only did it avoid talking about the gender of their partner, it also emphasized the platonic-ness of the relationship. Sometimes QPPs (queerplatonic partners) were referred to as zucchini, because of the frustration with lack of words to describe platonic relationship partners. This term was coined on the same Dreamwidth entry. The following quotes are excerpts from that Dreamwidth entry:</p>
            <p class="text-faded">“Ok, I am now referring to these kinds of relationships as zucchini. This is official, and so shall it be. I am actually not averse to borrowing a word from another language since English does that oh so very much anyhoodle. This is so frustrating because it feels like English forces me to define these relationships by something they are not, rather than what they are, and I loathe reverse definitions. Although I kind of like queerplatonic as a definer for the attraction I feel to my zucchini; it neatly avoids discussing the gender of either party involved, while emphasizing the idea that it is a deep (almost symbiotic in some ways) emotional connection that transcends what I think of as friendship. Hrm.”</p>
            <p class="text-faded">“ZUCCHINI. I am totally using that now. I also think borrowing may be a way to go, my main worries are whether we can find a word in another language that means what we want it to (sadly I'm only familiar with various Indo-European ones, German's not helpful because the word is cognate [although there, I should add, the words for friend and boy/girlfriend are actually the same], French has got the ami/e vs copain/copine distinction going on but I'm not sure what that actually means in practice... gah) and possible worries about appropriation. Although it *is* how languages work, so. :/ Oh my I liiiike queerplatonic. I think I've mentioned before that one of the options I play with is "having a queer romantic orientation" - I really *like* this because I think "queer" works really well for these sorts of "YOUR BOXES, THEY ARE INSUFFICIENT" relationships - zucchini and other sorts of vegetables - but I'm worried it'll end up reinforcing the idea that heteroromantic ace folk can't be queer.”</p>
