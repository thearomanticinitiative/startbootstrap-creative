                            were, ironically, those like the Queen who did not
                            wish to marry. Tudor society did not have many
                            avenues open to single women and, following the
                            Reformation, those avenues were even less. Before,
                            women were able to become nuns and look forward to
                            a rewarding life in convents, perhaps be a Mother
                            Superior one day. But with the Reformation, the
                            convents were closed. Wealthy single women
                            (heiresses of property) could look forward to being
                            mistress of their estates and wield the power in
                            the community this would bring, but for poor women,
                            the only long-term “career” really open to them was
                            domestic service. It was not surprising, therefore,
                            that most women married. Marriage was seen as the
                            desirable state for both men and women, and single
                            women were sometimes looked upon with suspicion. It
                            was mainly single women who were accused of being
                            witches by their neighbours.”</p>

                            intimacy). Single men and women are “extra”;
                            psychiatry shapes this picture of singles. In a
                            survey taken in 1957, eighty percent of Americans
                            believed that people who preferred to remain single
                            were “sick,” “neurotic,” or “immoral.” Unmarried
                            women were deemed suspect, as they could steal away
                            a husband at any time. And unwed men were seen as
                            “narcissistic, deviant, and pathological."</p>

                            in an effort to control women’s productive and
                            reproductive rights, in between World Wars I and
                            II. Women’s roles in society were starting to
                            diversify, and this was an effort to reassert
                            control. In order to be released, a man would have
                            to come and pay for the right to marry her. This
                            affected women who could not find a man to marry
                            and women who did not want to marry due to either
                            economic factors, her own autonomy, or the simple

                            men’s power over women is maintained, then
                            lesbianism is or can be a threat to that power.
                            This aspect of resistance involves all women
                            outside of heterosexuality, including celibate or
                            unmarried women. Like lesbians, they are all women
                            who are not subject to men’s social and sexual
                            power through a personal relationship. Thus,
                            although attacks were made on unmarried women
                            teachers primarily as spinsters rather than as
                            lesbians, it will be argued that they were maligned
                            for being outside heterosexuality.”</p>

                            single men, a number of unwed men adjust completely
                            to life without women and find a thoroughly
                            satisfying existence alone. Some of these seem to
                            have found fulfillment in their working life
                            exclusively. Examples can be found in every field.
                            Other men find a sense of completion by rounding
                            out their business lives with an engrossing hobby,
                            often in the sports field…</p>
                            <p>However well he may adjust to his lonely life,
                            the single man suffers disabilities that seem to be
                            traceable directly to his bachelorhood. Unwed men
                            are much less healthy than their married brothers.
                            Metropolitan Life Insurance Company studies show
                            that more than four times as many unattached men as
                            married men (ages 20–74) die of tuberculosis. At
                            ages 20–44, five to six times as many unmarried men
                            as husbands die of influenza and pneumonia. Prior
                            to mid-life, nine divorced men are victims of
                            cirrhosis of the liver to each married man killed
                            by that disease.”</p>

                            and can take earn of a wife, should get married,
                            and there should not be a lot of young men growing
                            up in our midst who ought to be, but are not
                            married. While I do not make the remark to apply to
                            individual cases, I am firmly of the opinion that a
                            large number of unmarried men, over the age of
                            twenty-four years, is a dangerous element in any
                            community, and an element upon which society should
                            look with a jealous eye. For every man knowing
                            himself, knows how his fellow-man is constituted;
                            and if men do not marry, they are too apt to do
                            something worse. Then, brethren, encourage our
                            young men to marry, and see that they are furnished
                            employment, so that they can marry” (George Q.

                coined?</h2>
                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">Queerplatonic was originally coined in a
                2010 Dreamwidth journal entry. It was considered a good term
                because not only did it avoid talking about the gender of their
                partner, it also emphasized the platonic-ness of the
                relationship. Sometimes QPPs (queerplatonic partners) were
                referred to as zucchini, because of the frustration with lack
                of words to describe platonic relationship partners. This term
                was coined on the same Dreamwidth entry. The following quotes
                are excerpts from that Dreamwidth entry:</p>
                <p class="text-faded">“Ok, I am now referring to these kinds of
                relationships as zucchini. This is official, and so shall it
                be. I am actually not averse to borrowing a word from another
                language since English does that oh so very much anyhoodle.
                This is so frustrating because it feels like English forces me
                to define these relationships by something they are not, rather
                than what they are, and I loathe reverse definitions. Although
                I kind of like queerplatonic as a definer for the attraction I
                feel to my zucchini; it neatly avoids discussing the gender of
                either party involved, while emphasizing the idea that it is a
                deep (almost symbiotic in some ways) emotional connection that
                transcends what I think of as friendship. Hrm.”</p>
                <p class="text-faded">“ZUCCHINI. I am totally using that now. I
                also think borrowing may be a way to go, my main worries are
                whether we can find a word in another language that means what
                we want it to (sadly I'm only familiar with various
                Indo-European ones, German's not helpful because the word is
                cognate [although there, I should add, the words for friend and
                boy/girlfriend are actually the same], French has got the ami/e
                vs copain/copine distinction going on but I'm not sure what
                that actually means in practice... gah) and possible worries
                about appropriation. Although it *is* how languages work, so.
                :/ Oh my I liiiike queerplatonic. I think I've mentioned before
                that one of the options I play with is "having a queer romantic
                orientation" - I really *like* this because I think "queer"
                works really well for these sorts of "YOUR BOXES, THEY ARE
                INSUFFICIENT" relationships - zucchini and other sorts of
                vegetables - but I'm worried it'll end up reinforcing the idea
                that heteroromantic ace folk can't be queer.”</p>
